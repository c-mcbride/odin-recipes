        <h1>Thin Crust Pizza</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Need a thin, cracker pizza to go with that crispy IPA. Look no further.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose four, plus more for kneading</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the toppings: </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups shredded cheese: one or a combination of mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan, fontina, romano, or asiago cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 450°F. Meanwhile, make the dough.</li>
            <li>Pour the water into a medium bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the flour and salt. Mix with a stiff spatula or wooden spoon until floury, shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead 
                until it forms a smooth, slightly tacky ball that springs back when you poke it, 5 to 8 minutes. If the dough sticks to your hands like bubblegum, 
                add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it’s easier to work with; avoid adding too much flour if possible.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with the upside-down bowl or a clean kitchen towel and let sit while you prepare the pizza toppings, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, stretch or roll it into a thin, 10- to 12-inch round. Form from the 
                middle of the dough outwards, using the heel of your hand to gently press and stretch the dough until it's about a 1/4-inch thick or less. For an 
                extra-thin crust, roll it with a rolling pin. If the dough starts to shrink back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then try rolling again.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven and place it upside down on a wire rack. Transfer the dough directly onto the upside-down 
                baking sheet. Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Spread 1/4 cup sauce into a thin layer onto dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle on 
                the cheese and other toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and cool for about
                 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.</li>
        </ol>
